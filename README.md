Semeser Project 2

Noroff 

This project is a game for my second semester project at Noroff Vocational school.

It is a 2D board game, made using vanilla JavaScript HTML & CSS. 

The basic idea is to make a board game for two players, where they race to the end by throwing a dice.
There is traps/events that set the players back, and by throwing 6 on the dice you get an extra turn.
